# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Overview of the business intelligence topic
> Business Intelligence topics are: Data Visualization/Dashboards, ETL/SQL Data model, Python Data modelling, Predictive Analytics.

- Significance of data-driven decision-making
> Airlines: I was nto satisfied with the Sem1 projects I submitted at christmas, have a personal oath to do better
> I like the car data, I think it is a great data set to learn on, as it is not too complex, but I can scale up the complexity if I want to.

- Goals of the presentation
> demonstrate my skills I have learned and developed in this course. Furthermore to improve on some topics I know I can do better on. For example the predictive analytics. This is something I have been struggling with, and as a way to improve my skill set, I am focusing on this for the final presentation.



## Presentation Candidate
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Joey Ramsay. I have my bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Enterprise Systems. My education provided me with an array of knowledge from training in SQL, basics in database deisgn, and enterprise (IT) management strategies. I have worked professionally as an entry level ABAP Programmer for IBM, and as an IT Analyst for IMP Solutions - before deciding to return to NSCC to further my education.

I do not have as much experience with BI tools as I would like - which is the main reason why I'm in this program. During my time in University, Tableu was at the height of its popularity, and we used that for a few courses. I remember loving Tableau and it's functionalities, the software helped me discover a passion or Business Intelligence. The visualization of data and helping portray the data's story is extremely rewarding for myself. Sadly, I did not gain much of any BI experience while at IMP. But on the flip side, I learned so much in regards to IT management, networking, and troubleshooting, that I know it has helped me understand how these BI tools can be effective across a large company. 




## Data Selection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Airline Data OR Car Sales data... Not sure what I like more.
-- Car sales data for predicting what future car prices? or a trend in prices over time... idk ask pat!!!

Relevance for the Airline:

Car Sales: I will be honest, before I found this data set I was debating on using a sports gambling data set with March Madness odds. But I didn't know the schools policies on gambling, and didn't want to step on any toes.

- Criteria for choosing the dataset
- Potential sources for data acquisition
- Relevance of the chosen data to the business domain

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The selected BI techniques I will be focusing on will be as follows: 
- Data Visualization/Dashboards
- ETL/SQL Data model
- Predictive Analytics
- Python Data modelling (maybe)

Application & Insights:
- Data Visualization
    > IF Airlines: Through this course I have always used the same data set. I consider this deliverable the 'Final Boss' in my visualization adventure while at NSCC. I Will have an improved map displaying the flights, directions and (relative) flight path. The map will be on top of a well constructed dashboard focusing on trends in the data with basic bar charts, line/scatter plots etc.
    
    > IF Cars: Try to have a nice Bar chart that displays the car or the car manufacturers logo on the bar chart.
    *** Could drop visualization portion for cars. ***

Insights: 
    Airline - Clearly see the trends and patterns in flights per airline. Visaully see the high traffic flight areas.

    Car Sales - View all the difference in sale prices, state registration and sellers across all cars models and makes.

  

- ETL/SQL
    > For BOTH possible data sets, they come in relativeley flat files. To report on the data it will need to be cleaned and formatted. Taking the data from its raw CSV to a completed, normalized (or denormalized for reporting) database schema. 
    > Airlines: multiple tables to create, have CSV for some dimensions.
    > Car Sales: Will need to create hierarchy of cars make, model and trim. Also had some data incorrectly input, need to fix.

Insights:
    BOTH - Data needs to be formatted, for number of columns of date and time. Possibly be able to identify duplicate records during the process.


- Predictive Analytics
    > Have not yet decided the model or method. But ideas so far:
    > Airlines: Predictive model that shows airline most likely to have delay (maybe greater than a min limit)
    > Car Sales: Model to predict the price of cars for future upload. If someone inputs a car the website can give reccommended price. Based on attributes like year, mmr (historical?), odometer, 

Insights:
    Airline - Predict the delay times for airlines for certain flights??
    ***** Something I need to ask Pat for help with. Not sure where to go with this. ******

- Python Data modelling (maybe)
    > Thought maybe this was the same thing as the ETL/SQL as in it has the same objective; to have cleaned efficient data model/set.
    > Would probably involve a lot of EDA or something along those lines.

Insights:
    BOTH - Similar to the ETL/SQL except here able to perform and visualize an extremely useful EDA. Displaying trends in the data easily and concisely.


## Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Schedule for the development of the presentation
    > My plan is already in motion. As I have been trying to get the data structured to my liking as this proposal is being worked on.
    > Complete data cleaning by this weekend sometime (MINIMUM). And then next week beging diving into creating the best airline dashboard ever. 

- Necessary resources (BI tools, datasets, etc.)
    > Will be using power BI to create the report.
    > Cleaning data with combination of python and Power Query.
    > Structure tables with MSSQL
    > Data sets are both from Kaggle
- Rehearsals and feedback sessions

- Encouragement for audience engagement

## Appendices
---------------------------------------------------------------------
