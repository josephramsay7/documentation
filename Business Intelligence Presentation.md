# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------
For my final BI presentation, I will be focusing on the following topics from our allowed list: ETL/SQL Data model, Data Visualization/Dashboards, and Predictive Analytics. I'll use these topics to create somewhat of a 'pipeline' for my data. This hypothetical pipleine will be displaying skills I have learned throught the entirety of the whole course. Beginning with the ETL/SQL modelling, transforming the data in MSSQL to have a clean, de-normalized reporting schema. Then using the schema to construct a useful dashboard to visually look at trends of car prices. Finishing with a small predictive analytical analysis of the data set, which can help predict the price of a car if someone is looking to receive a quote on their car.

The significance is with creating a tool as the one I described above, I can predict the future value of cars. If I was in the market for a new car, I could use this to help me determine the best deal. This type of model is extremely interesting to me, even though this will not be the most complex predictive model, it is an amazing starting point to allow myself to dive much deeper into the topic over my (hopefully) long career. 

The goal of the presentation is to not only demonstrate the skills I have learned in this course, but also how to apply those skills to an array of datasets/situations. It is also a great tool for me to tidy up and focus on some skills that I need some help with. For example I have felt a little behind in the predictive analystical topics we have covered, so I need to improve my understanding of that. And from your teachings, there is no better way to improve at something than to practice repeatedly. 


## Presentation Candidate
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Joey Ramsay. I have my bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Enterprise Systems. My education provided me with an array of knowledge from training in SQL, basics in database deisgn, and enterprise (IT) management strategies. I have worked professionally as an entry level ABAP Programmer for IBM, and as an IT Analyst for IMP Solutions - before deciding to return to NSCC to further my education.

I do not have as much experience with BI tools as I would like - which is the main reason why I'm in this program. During my time in University, Tableu was at the height of its popularity, and we used that for a few courses. I remember loving Tableau and it's functionalities, the software helped me discover a passion for Business Intelligence. The visualization of data and helping portray the data's story is extremely rewarding for myself. I knew when I moved on from UNiversity Business Intelligence was a field I wanted to work in.

Working at IBM, the minimal BI experience I gained was from the Business/Data warehousing of SAP work I did. I didn't gain much technical skills from that, due to my short tenure, but my understanding of data warehousing and how important it is really stuck with me. Sadly, I did not gain much of any BI experience while at IMP. The role was more IT support and I was focused on helping end users. But on the flip side, I learned so much in regards to IT management, networking, and troubleshooting, that I know has helped me through this course on the daily.


## Data Selection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My data is focused on used Car sales throughout the USA. Before I decided on this type of dataset, I was debating on using a sports gambling dataset with March Madness odds. But I didn't know the schools policies on gambling, and didn't want to step on any toes. Furthermore, After some research, I found that the precitions I was looking to make were a little to advanced for my skill level at this time. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew for this project, so I decided on my data - car sales in the USA.

There is an endless amount of sources for this type of data. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to pick the right one. I listed all of the potential sources (urls) below. I had some troubles finding a dataset that had a timeline from before the COVID-19 pandemic to after. So for now I am gathering 2 datasets, the first from 2015 and the second from 2020 to comapare and contrast results.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The selected BI techniques I will be focusing on will be as follows: 
- Data Visualization/Dashboards
- ETL/SQL Data model
- Predictive Analytics
I will have a main focus on the data visualization/dashboard, which requires a strong data model built for reporting. Closing out the project with some predictive analytics on the potential prices for cars and maybe some other tricks I have up my sleeves. What I want to accomplish is a dashboard that is simplistic, uniform, and informative. While also being colorful, informative and legible.

 ### Data Visualization
Application: My application of good visualization techniques. Simple things like not having the graphs legible, clear, and doesn't have end users guessing as to what the charts are trying to portray. I will have the Power BI presentation split up into sections, powerpoint style. Which would give me a lot of real estate to have a lot of meaningful information displayed. 

Insights: To be able to view all the differences in sale prices across all cars makes and models along with their location. These intial visuals may be able to give us an idea as to what the predictive analytics will uncover.

 ### ETL/SQL
Application: With the downloaded data being flat files, it is relatively easy to import into any database system. To report on the data it will need to be cleaned and formatted. Taking the data from its raw CSV to a completed, normalized (or denormalized for reporting) database schema. I will need to take into accout the hierarchy of cars make, and model. Ensuring I structure the data accordingly. Also there is some data incorrectly input, I will need to address this.

Insights: Within this process we can expose any possible duplicates, null values to be removed, and/or any discrepencies in the data.

 ### Predictive Analytics
Application: I will be using a regression model to predict the price of cars, present and current vehicles. Based on attributes like year, make, model, odometer, and possibly color. Using all of the same tactics we have learned in class recently, this will further assis drive home these basic principals of data analytics.

Insights: The goal is to be able to gain insights of future values of automobiles. Hopefuly with a well constructed regression model, we will be able to identify trends and patterns in pricing.


## Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My plan is already in motion. As I have been trying to get the data structured to my liking since before this proposal was started. I am hopeful to have completed the cleaning, structuring, and all foundational tasks to my liking by the end of this month. Allowing me time to really focus on my dashboard and predictive analytical models. Hoefully a few days (maybe a week) before the final due date and presentations are due, I will have a good rough draft ready to be finalized. I will need to be efficient with my time since I am tackling to use a number of tools and softwares for my project.

As for the tools, I will be using MSSQL for the cleaning and ETL processes. I may use some python to assist my cleaning, but we will see. There is some things about Python that I love for cleaning data! The dashboard will be created with Power BI. Power BI is very powerfull and will be able to present all of what I want to accomplish. Finally, the predictive analytics will be done with old reliable Python in our pycaret environment.

I was lucky enough to find both of my data sets (2015 & 2020) on Kaggle.com. I did roam the internet for some other examples, but I wasn't able to find exactly what I was looking for.

## Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Although this is the blandest proposal document to ever touch earth, I hope my writing makes up for the lack of formatting. I am here to conclude that the contributions of this project will help me further my career in Business Intelligence and Analytics. Everything I have learned in these courses is exactly what I want to do as a professional. Projects like this help me advance my skill set.
