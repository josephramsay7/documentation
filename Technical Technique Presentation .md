# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal

## Introduction

Data Wrangling - A step in the data analysis process that finally allows data scientist become a the cowboy they've always wanted to be. They're required to 'wrangle' up the data with a plethora of techniques. In this technical presentation, I will be going over wrangling data in the 'Date' formats. Sometimes when beginning a data analysis journey, we can stumble across all types of date & time formatting within datasets. An easy to use function that can turn any date/time column into a desired format would be really cool. Unfortunatley I won't be able to do that.. But I will be able to show you some techniques for specific Date/Time columns and wrangling them in.

Data wrangling is crutial in the data analysis process. Importance is so high because data quality ensures accurate, consistent, and error free data. Without following necessary data wrangling protocols to clean the data, leads to the data being more difficult to work with. Having data that is reliable will lead to gaining reliable information. As the old saying goes 'Garbage in, Garbage out.', implying if you work with garbage, your end product will most likely also be garbage. So wrangle your data, kids!

- Objectives of the presentation
Objective is to show the viewer methods in converting date and time columns. There is a lot of differnt ways to do so, but I will only be covering 1-2. ***** Need to decide what I'm doing ******


## Background
- Current state of technology in the domain

The biggest challenge for this topic is the endless possibilities that dates can be provided. Anything from YYYY-DD-MM to DD-MM-YY. Also when there is little to no documentation or indication of which number is which, challenges can arise quickly. There is no perfect function (yet) that can fix all date/time conversions. I wish I could come up with that.

## Presentation Candidate
My name is Joey Ramsay. I have my bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Enterprise Systems. My education provided me with an array of knowledge from training in SQL, basics in database deisgn, and enterprise (IT) management strategies. I have worked professionally as an entry level ABAP Programmer for IBM, and as an IT Analyst for IMP Solutions - before deciding to return to NSCC to further my education.

Although my education and experience involved a number of IT topics, nothing has prepared me for data wrangling. I had vaguely heard of it before attending NSCC, but had no idea how important it really was. It is an endless beast that can be tackled a hundred different ways. I am very excited to take a deeper dive into this topic, as I know it will assist me further along in my career. 


## Sample Data Selection
My sample data set I will be using one of the datasets from my Business Intelligence presentation. The dataset will be the 2015 car sales.
