# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Wrangling - A step in the data analysis process that finally allows data scientist become a the cowboy they've always wanted to be. They're required to 'wrangle' up the data with a plethora of techniques. In this technical presentation, I will be going over wrangling data in from the 'Date' formats. Sometimes when beginning a data analysis journey, we can stumble across all types of date & time formatting within datasets. An easy to use function that can turn any date/time column into a desired format would be really cool. Unfortunatley I won't be able to do that.. BUT I will be able to show you some techniques for specific Date/Time situations and how to handle them with Data Wrangling techniques.

Data wrangling is crutial in the data analysis process. Importance is so high because data quality ensures accurate, consistent, and error free data. Without following necessary data wrangling protocols to clean the data, this leads to the data being more difficult to work with. Having data that is reliable will lead to gaining reliable information. As the old saying goes 'Garbage in, Garbage out.', implying if you work with garbage, your end product will most likely also be garbage. So wrangle your data, kids!

Objective is to show the viewer some methods in converting date and time columns. There is a lot of different ways to do so, but I will only be covering a specific instance. I will be demonstrating a function that splits data columns into desired column. I will go into more detail in the coming sections.

## Background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Converting Date and time functionality is (in my opinion) is actually okay. It is far from perfect, but it works with functions like 
The biggest challenge for this topic is the endless possibilities that dates can be provided. Anything from YYYY-DD-MM to DD-MM-YY. Also when there is little to no documentation or indication of which number is which, challenges can arise quickly. There is no perfect function (yet) that can fix all date/time conversions. I wish I could come up with that.

## Presentation Candidate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Joey Ramsay. I have my bachelor's degree in Business Administration, majoring in Enterprise Systems. My education provided me with an array of knowledge from training in SQL, basics in database deisgn, and enterprise (IT) management strategies. I have worked professionally as an entry level ABAP Programmer for IBM, and as an IT Analyst for IMP Solutions - before deciding to return to NSCC to further my education.

Although my education and experience involved a number of IT topics, nothing has prepared me for data wrangling. I had vaguely heard of it before attending NSCC, but had no idea how important it really was. It is an endless beast that can be tackled a hundred different ways. I am very excited to take a deeper dive into this topic, as I know it will assist me further along in my career. 

## Sample Data Selection
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
My sample data set I will be using one of the datasets from my Business Intelligence presentation. The dataset will be the 2015 car sales. This section had a messy date and time stamp. Which gives me a perfect opportunity to apply these skills. I will be demonstrating the techniques on this data set and possible one more.

## Technical Technique Demonstration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technique is going to be an easy to use function that can parse out the full date (month, day, and year) from a column. Steps will include calling the function and entering the desired (dirty) date columns into the function. Then the results will be able to be pushed back into the parent dataset. Constructing a full collection of required date columns. Wrangling dates is always a unique situation, and should be handled with on an event to event basis.

## Implementation Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement this type of a project, I need to do one thing - Practice. My function skills are not the best, and this is a perfect opportunity to improve on that. Which is one reason why I am happy to be in team Wrangling.

Over the coming weeks I will have to take a deep dive into learning existing methods to parse out dates. Advance my current knowledge of dates and functions, to allow me to generate something functional and useful.

## Conclusion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To conclude, I will be focusing on the parsing of dates from dirty data. Cleaning seperating the date to the desired format. The solution will be able to identify and ammend any erros or invalid dates and accoutn for leap years. Cleaning data will make everyones lives involved easier.
